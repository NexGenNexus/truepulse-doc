# The benefits of  TruePulse
When contrasted with traditional price feed systems, TruePulse boasts several key benefits:

## High Transactions per second in TON:
Due to TON's significantly high TPS, the wait time during the verification period can be reduced. For instance, while Ethereum requires a 12-second wait for each block, TON can achieve a block every second. Therefore, if price verification necessitates 10 blocks, it would only take 10 seconds on TON as opposed to 120 seconds on Ethereum. Consequently, employing oracles on TON can provide more immediate and efficient pricing.

## Decentralization
TruePulse operates in a fully open and complimentary manner, facilitating price proposals and validations through a non-cooperative game approach. This eliminates the need for any centralized oversight or entry barriers for the quoting system, allowing anyone to participate or disengage freely, anytime and anywhere.

## Stability and Safeguarding
TruePulse empowers all participants to contribute to and shape the price formation on the blockchain. Concurrently, it guides the price data towards a fair market value, safeguarded by its underlying mechanism. Orchestrating a price manipulation requires control over 51% of the assets within the oracle's network. Any anomalies in pricing within the TruePulse are subject to adjustment by the collective efforts of all validators.

:::info summarizing 
TruePulse offers faster transactions and fairer pricing compared to older systems. It uses a fast network called TON, so verifying prices happens quicker. It's open to everyone, without a boss, making it fairer. Prices stay stable because everyone helps decide them, making it harder to cheat.
